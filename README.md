## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks

# #1 Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
● Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of 
study hours 

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data 

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● Task submission: 
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn profile
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

# #2 Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Task submission: 
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn profile
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

# #3 Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this  classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. 

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Task submission:
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in a video. Post the video on YouTube 
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn profile 
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

# #4 Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
● Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines 

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX) 

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com 

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6 

● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model 

● Depending on the accuracy of the model and quality of the task, we will endorse your work and help you publish it.

# #5 To Explore Business Analytics
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset  ‘SampleSuperstore’ 

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.  

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the  data? 

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice  (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel) 

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl 

● Intermediate Level - Create storyboards. Screen-record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations. 

● Task submission: 
1. Create the dashboards and/or storyboard and record it 
2. Upload the recording on Youtube, share the link on LinkedIn 
3. Submit LinkedIn post link in Task Submission Form when shared

# #6 Timeline Analysis : Covid-19
● Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) 

● Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story 

● Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts 

● Use Tableau or Power BI for this task (Here I am using Python).

● Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations. 

● Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on https://bit.ly/30d2gdi 

● Task submission: 
1. Create the dashboards and/or storyboard and record it 
2. Upload the recording on Youtube, share the link on LinkedIn 
3. Submit LinkedIn post link in Task Submission Form when shared
